# First we need to check the job description and then we will be checking the years of experience required 
because both plays a crucial role. and then we match the skills which is requrired for the job and the candidate experience and also we can check the university from which he 
graduated or the comany he worked from this we give the weights for each individauls and also for the ats score match with the job description.
and then we evaluate the project decription and the linkedin to scrape the website and get the information. and weigh it with the and compare it and give the score as a graph for each individaul
then we can get the best candidate and then we select thorse candidate show it to the company.

What are the things required

React or NextJS
For backend: we dont need backend for this right now we can go with the data we have in json format.
For styling we can use tailwind or bootstrap 3 for responsive design.

Wireframing.


we need to create an api where we will be using gemini api and this will call 
the backend current api to find the diverse 
team of 5 people based on skills and job description using the current approach
and on top of it we will be using the MCP server of fastapi to call the api and get the 5 diverse 
talent from the api calls made by mcp assynchronously and give me the reason for why 5 developers as been hired as an 
api out put
the api will be taking the job description and gave the proper skills to get top details of the candidate by considering the 
people who required for diverse start ups which includes the maximum skills and top candidates from the resume by considering the overall skills
which we have from the current api so that we will be having the diverse and best team by utilizing this so we need one solid api which gives the top 5 people after evaluation of all the factors and also it shoudl give why they should hired
to the start up seed funders.
I have added gemini api in the .env folder for calling the gemini ai assiatant to call the other api to initiate mcp and get the results.
